# Hayden Burnell Portfolio
## Completely upgraded Portfolio from last year

Final Project for IDP33- Fully functional responsive portfolio site live online at [HBurnell.com](https://hburnell.com)
Includes my logo, navigation, my resumes, portfolio pieces, feature page using API/AJAX/Vue, and a functional contact page linked to my personal email.

## Installation
For the Homepage and the contact page, just enter the url into any browser (firefox, chrome, brave are recommended)

For the feature page, you will have to view it using Live Server. Clone the repo to your local device, open in VScode, and open Live Server from there.

## Usage
Open in Live Server to view the project, or [Click Here](https://hburnell.com) to see the live site. You might get a warning saying the site is not secure that you will have to manually bypass. I won't hack you.

CSS is generated with SASS using the command line tools. You'll need dart-sass (preferred) - [you can get it here](https://sass-lang.com/install)

## Database
In the Database folder includes a .sql file of my portfolio database and a text file of sql queries to view specific data.
