#Hayden Burnell Portfolio
##Completely upgraded Portfolio from last year

Final Project for IDP33- Fully functional responsive portfolio site live online at [HBurnell.com](https://hburnell.com)
Includes my logo, navigation, my resumes, portfolio pieces, feature page using API/AJAX/Vue, and a functional contact page linked to my personal email.

## Installation
For the Homepage and the contact page, just enter the url into any browser (firefox, chrome, brave are recommended)

For the feature page, you will have to view it using Live Server. Clone the repo to your local device, open in VScode, and open Live Server from there.

## Usage
Open in Live Server to view the project, or [Click Here](https://hburnell.com) to see the live site.

CSS is generated with SASS using the command line tools. You'll need dart-sass (preferred) - [you can get it here](https://sass-lang.com/install)
